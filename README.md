# Basic Node website

-When run locally with node index.js it will execute the node http server code and fetch
pages from the html/ folder

-The reaason it works from a github.io deployment is because the github servers know what to do with these files, they're serving them but its 
not my node code running

-To access these "pages" you can go to the https://teomeoteo.github.io/node-basic/html url and from there you can add /about or /contact-us
